## DEX for Startups

The main idea of this project is to serve as an exchange for startups. One of the big problems that this industry has, is: *low liquidity* - once you buy a startup stock, normally you have to wait until an **event of liquidity**, to being able to get out of your position. So people can't give away even if this investment become a bad one. In 2020, in Brazil, this market exceeded US$ 2,2 billions.
